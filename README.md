# Handwritten-digit-reconition

Build a machine learning or deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

### Why it is Important ?
It demonstrates how AI can mimic human abilities in recognizing and interpreting visual data.
It serves as the foundation for real world application optical character recognition.

Approach: Train the model on a standard dataset to identify patterns and generalize across various handwriting styles.
